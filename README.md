# TicTacToe-AI
This project is one that I worked on in my Object Oriented Programming class, 
it is a Tic Tac Toe program that allows you to play against someone else or to play against an AI
the AI using a min max algorithm to find the best possible move it could take meaning it is impossible to beat
It works by giving the player every option they can take and having them enter an index as to what move should be made
The code is written fully in
The AI game is run by executing the VSComputer file and the Player game is run by executing the PVPGame file
After downloading the project compile VSComputer and PVPGame and then run them
Below is a video of the game being played on a terminal:
